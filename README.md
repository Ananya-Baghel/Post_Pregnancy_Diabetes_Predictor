# Post Pregnancy Diabetes Predictor

This project aims to analyze and predict the likelihood of diabetes in women post-pregnancy using real-world health datasets. The solution involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling using machine learning.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Jupyter

## 📊 Features
- Preprocessing using KNN imputation to handle missing/zero values
- Comprehensive data visualization and statistical summaries
- Distribution analysis using histograms and pie charts
- Classification modeling to detect diabetes risk
- Outcome-based insights for better healthcare intervention

## 📁 Dataset
PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset, accessed via local CSV file

## 📈 Objectives
- Understand feature correlations affecting diabetes post-pregnancy
- Predict diabetes outcomes using clinical attributes
- Empower healthcare with data-driven decisions

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `diabetes_analysis_12019002001131.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Ensure required libraries are installed.
